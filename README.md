# Payroll Management System (DBMS)

## Introduction

The **Payroll Management System** is a comprehensive solution designed to manage and streamline payroll operations for organizations. It leverages **PHP** for backend processing and a relational database for handling data storage and retrieval. This system provides a seamless way to manage employee records, payroll data, deductions, and leave tracking through a user-friendly web interface.

The system ensures accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in payroll management, benefiting both employers and employees.

## System Implementation

### Backend Architecture

The backend of this system is implemented using **PHP**, which interacts with an Oracle database to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. PHP scripts dynamically process user inputs from the web interface and translate them into SQL queries to interact with the database.

The database is structured with several entities, such as **Employer**, **Employee**, **Payroll**, **Deductions**, and **Leave**, each representing a critical aspect of payroll management. Relationships between these entities ensure data integrity and efficient handling of payroll operations.

### Operations Supported by the System

#### Table and Schema Management
- **Create Tables**: Automatically generate the database schema, including all required tables, views, and sequences.
- **Drop Tables**: Safely remove tables, views, and sequences from the database when resetting or reinitializing the system.

#### Data Management
- **Insert Data**: Populate the database with sample or real-world data for entities such as employees, employers, payroll periods, deductions, and leaves.
- **Update Data**: Modify specific fields in any table by providing the table name, column name, new value, and a condition.  
  *Example*: Update an employee’s hourly rate or a payroll record’s bonus amount.
- **Delete Data**: Remove specific records from a table based on a condition. Useful for cleaning up outdated or incorrect data.
- **View Data**: Retrieve and display the contents of any table in the database for a clear overview of stored data.

#### Query Execution
- **Predefined Queries**: The system includes several predefined queries to retrieve insights and perform operations such as:
  - Calculating total payroll for each employer.
  - Identifying employees with gross income exceeding a specific threshold.
  - Tracking total leave hours taken by employees in a specific year.
- **Custom Queries**: Users can define and execute their own SQL queries to retrieve specific information or perform advanced operations.

#### Leave and Deduction Management
- Record and manage employee leave details, including leave hours, start and end dates, and associated deductions.
- Track statutory and voluntary deductions, ensuring they are accurately applied to employee payroll.

#### Advanced Payroll Features
- **Gross and Net Income Calculation**: Automatically calculate gross and net income for employees based on their hourly rates, total work hours, and applicable deductions.
- **Bonus Management**: Add bonuses to employee payroll records as needed.
- **Overtime Tracking**: Monitor and record overtime hours for employees, incorporating them into payroll calculations.

#### Dynamic Web Operations
Through a simple and intuitive web interface, users can:
- **Update Column Values**: Modify any column in any table dynamically by specifying the table name, column name, new value, and condition.
- **Search for Specific Values**: Query specific columns in any table based on conditions.
- **Delete Records**: Remove records that meet specified conditions.
- **View Entire Tables**: Display the contents of any table in a readable format.

### Workflow

#### 1. User Interaction
Users interact with the system through an HTML-based web interface. For instance, they can fill out a form to update an employee’s hourly rate or view all payroll records.

#### 2. Backend Processing
PHP scripts process user inputs, construct SQL queries, and execute them against the Oracle database. The system validates inputs to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.

#### 3. Result Display
Results from database operations are displayed in the browser. For example, after running a query, the system shows the output as a formatted HTML table.

## Use Cases

Here are some practical scenarios where the Payroll Management System can be used:

- **Payroll Disbursement**: Employers can calculate gross and net pay for all employees based on work hours, bonuses, and deductions.
- **Leave Tracking**: Employers can track employee leave records and calculate their impact on payroll.
- **Performance Insights**: Advanced queries can identify high-performing employees who work overtime or determine employers with above-average payroll expenses.
- **Data Cleanup**: Administrators can delete records for employees who have left the company or whose data is outdated.
